## I noticed the Moon sometimes passes in front of the Sun, but there is no solar eclipse, why?

I haven't yet gotten around to adding Solar Eclipses, but they will be in the mod one day. It would be easy to do a hardcoded solar eclipse, but since every single aspect of Stellar View can be changed using Resourcepacks, adding solar eclipses that behave properly even when some values are changed using Resourcepacks will require a bunch of math (mainly trigonometry, which will be... quite interesting to do I suppose).


## Does this mod work with Shaders?

Kinda? It's not gonna crash when you play with Shaders, but most Shaderpacks disregard any sky effects and replace them with their own custom sky effects, overriding the changes Stellar View brings.
Some packs can be configurated to disable their own sky and allow Stellar View sky to render.

HOWEVER!!! Note that for Stellar View stars and dust clouds to work with any shaderpack, you must set the ***Static Sky*** config option to *True*!
If it's not set to true, the stars and dust clouds will render dynamically using a custom core vertex shader, which isn't allowed by rendering mods like Iris.

Here is a list of Shaders that can definitely be made to work with Stellar View (stars + dust clouds included) and the settings used to make them work, feel free to inform us over at the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VDSqzdBqRd) if you find any more:

## Why does my server crash when I boot it up with Stellar View installed?

Stellar View is a client-only mod (as of the time of writing this at least), so it should only be placed in the mods folder of your own Minecraft installation and not the server's.
This also means that you can play with it on Vanilla servers.

UPDATE: As of the version 0.4.0, this should no longer happen. Stellar View still won't change anything on the serverside (at least for now), but it won't crash either.
