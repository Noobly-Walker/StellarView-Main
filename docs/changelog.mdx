## 0.3.1 - 2024 Oct 19 - 1.19.2~1.21.1
- **Updated to Minecraft 1.21.1 - HUGE thanks for the port to NeoForge 1.21.1 done entirely by Erdragh**

## 0.3.0 - 2024 Oct 06 - 1.19.2~1.20.1
- Added:
  - ***Resourcepack compatibility*** - Every single aspect of the mod can now be modified through the use of Resourcepacks. You can even add new objects to the sky.
  - ***View Center system*** - View Centers (which can be edited through Resourcepacks) can specify which planet (or any other object really) you're viewing the sky from. They will, by default, work with any dimension using dimension effects of Overworld, Nether and End. Any additional custom dimension effects added by mods can be easily edited into being compatible with the View Center system by their respective mod authors, if they choose to do so.
  - Conversion system for equatorial coordinates, allowing you to write down coordinates for any object using its J2000 epoch coordinates you can easily find for real-life space objects and make them appear where they should in-game.
  - Nebulae: Crab Nebula, Dumbell Nebula, Eagle Nebula, Lagoon Nebula, Orion Nebula, and Ring Nebula
  - Andromeda Galaxy
  - Triangulum Galaxy
  - Added Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy
  - Satellite galaxies: Antila 2, Crater 2 Dwarf, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud, Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroid, M32, and M110
  - Alpha Centauri system: Rigil Kentaurus, Toliman, and Proxima Centauri, along with Proxima b, c, and d
- Fixed:
  - Minimized sky jitter caused by high time values (billions of ticks in the future)


## 0.2.4 - 2024 May 26
- Changed:
  - Textures no longer use flipped UV by default (the Moon still uses flipped UV, because that's how Vanilla Minecraft does it)
- Fixed:
  - Barycenter objects not rendering
  - Sun showing up at night


## 0.2.3 Hotfix - 2024 May 24 - 1.19.2~1.20.1
- Fixed:
  - Galaxy API problems that can cause crashes related to compatibility
  - Galaxy rotation being incorrectly affected by the year length config slider


## 0.2.3 - 2024 May 24 - 1.19.2~1.20.1
***HUGE thanks to Noobly Walker who practically carried most this update***

  - Barycenter object class
  - Star spectral classes - Stars are now divided into distinct spectral classes (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) which dictate their size and brightness and are by default distributed based on real life (most stars are M-class), the distribution can be made uniform in the config
  - Added multiple meteor shower colors
  - Added a bunch of config settings for how stars appear
- Changed:
  - Stars now lose brightness with distance, giving a more 3D feel to the Milky Way galaxy
