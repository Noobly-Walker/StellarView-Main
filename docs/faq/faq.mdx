## I noticed the Moon sometimes passes in front of the Sun, but there is no solar eclipse, why?

I haven't yet gotten around to adding Solar Eclipses, but they will be in the mod one day. It would be easy to do a hardcoded solar eclipse, but since every single aspect of Stellar View can be changed using Resourcepacks, adding solar eclipses that behave properly even when some values are changed using Resourcepacks will require a bunch of math (mainly trigonometry, which will be... quite interesting to do I suppose).


## Does this mod work with Shaders?

Kinda, but not really? It's not gonna crash when you play with Shaders, but most Shaderpacks disregard any sky effects and replace them with their own custom sky effects, overriding the changes Stellar View brings.

[Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/), for example, only override the galaxies added by Stellar View, but still allow the planets and moons to be visible. And I'm sure I've seen at least one shaderpack that allows Stellar View to work properly, but unfortunately I have no idea what it was called.

If you do find some Shaders that are compatible with Stellar View, feel free to inform us over at the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VDSqzdBqRd).


## Why does my server crash when I boot it up with Stellar View installed?

Stellar View is a client-only mod (as of the time of writing this at least), so it should only be placed in the mods folder of your own Minecraft installation and not the server's.
This also means that you can play with it on Vanilla servers.
