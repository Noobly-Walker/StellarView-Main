# Star Field

A Star Field is a type of Space Object that defines the shape and size of a collection of stars and dust clouds,
which means it can be used to represent star clusters and galaxies.

## Definition

* `parent_location` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the path (Resource Location) the object's [parent](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/space_objects).
* `coords` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the space coordinates of the object.
* `axis_rotation` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the rotation of the object around its individual axes (X axis -> Z axis -> Y axis).

* `dust_clouds` *OPTIONAL* - Specifies the number of dust clouds that generate in the Star Field. [Min = 0 | Max = 4000]
* `dust_cloud_info` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the path to the [Dust Cloud Info](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/star_and_dust_cloud_info) file reference.
* `dust_cloud_texture` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the path to the texture file used for rendering the dust cloud texture.
* `clump_dust_clouds_in_center` *OPTIONAL* - Decides whether dust clouds should be evenly distributed around the Star Field or if they should clump around the center, true by default.
* `dust_cloud_stretch` *OPTIONAL* - Specifies the dust cloud stretch along each of the Star Field's relative axes.

* `stars` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the number of stars that generate in the Star Field. [Min = 0 | Max = 30000]
* `star_info` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the path to the [Star Info](https://moddedmc.wiki/cs/project/stellarview/docs/resourcepacks/star_and_dust_cloud_info) file reference.
* `star_texture` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the path to the texture file used for rendering the star texture.
* `clump_stars_in_center` *OPTIONAL* - Decides whether dust clouds should be evenly distributed around the Star Field or if they should clump around the center, true by default.
* `star_stretch` *OPTIONAL* - Specifies the star stretch along each of the Star Field's relative axes.

* `seed` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the seed used for randomizing the Star Field's generation.
* `diameter_ly` **REQUIRED** - Specifies the Star Field's diameter in Light Years.
* `spiral_arms` *OPTIONAL* - Defines the Star Field's individual Spiral Arms.

### Star Stretch / Dust Cloud Stretch

Stretch, as the name implies, stretches the coordinates along which a star or a dust cloud generates.
This means that if a Star Field's is stretch defined as { "x": 1.0, "y": 0.25, "z": 1.0 },
a star that would have otherwise generated at coordinates (4, 4, 4) will instead generate at coordinates (4, 1, 4).
Note that these stretched coordinates are relative to the Star Field's Axis Rotation.
