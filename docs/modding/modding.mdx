title: Modding and dependency
hide_meta: true

Stellar View started out as a side project when I was figuring out how to add custom sky effects in [Stargate Journey](https://povstalec.github.io/StargateJourney/) to see what is possible to achieve while rendering stars in Minecraft.
It quickly evolved into its own mod when I found out how exactly star positions are calculated and started using simple transformations to shape them into more complex structures.
Since it was initially made to enhance the views from different planets in Stargate Journey, Stellar View is built with compatibility in mind.
